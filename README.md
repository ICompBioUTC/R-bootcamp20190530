# R-bootcamp-REU2019 May 30-31

20190530 Notes:
 GitHub clients require github username, merge and sync, which are too much for the R-bootcamp. So, students should donwload the ZIP files. 

Wireless download take long itme. Should ask students to install R, Rstudio before bootcamps, or have files on flashdrives, or a shared GoogleDrive. Projector did not work at first. We have to use Zoom initially. Github sync is also a distraction for basic R learning, and should be avoided in the R bootcamps.
Some students have trouble with Rmd and markdown files. Some students are confused by knitr and console running.
